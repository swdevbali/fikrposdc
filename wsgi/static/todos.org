This is all coding tasks that left to make the final phase of the application complete. I have one important obstacle : I really, really need a hand on the POS Printer. Haven't have time to meet my friend who sold it. At the minimum, I must be able to rent it. Task with TODO is task that currently being working on.

* Create API for registering of user from desktop client application
  I also need this to easily do unit test of the application.
** Add HTTP Basic Authentication in RESTful API 
* Creating application initialisation scenario with DC communication in mind. Personal plan is skipped at the moment.

* Product and category initialization from Cloud
* Branch, User and POS instance registering to the Cloud
